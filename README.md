# Subnetter

The code creates a GUI subnet calculator using the tkinter module in Python. It allows the user to input an IP address, select the number of subnets, and choose a subnet mask. When the user clicks the "Calculate" button, the program calculates the subnets for the given input and displays them in a listbox. The user can select and copy the subnet information from the listbox. The program uses the ipaddress module to calculate the subnets.
